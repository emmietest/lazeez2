Place the provided Lazeez Eats logo image here as `logo.png`.

Path (workspace-relative): static/logo.png

When using Vite, files in `static/` are served at the site root. After placing the image, the Navbar will load it at `/logo.png`.

Steps:
1. Save the attached image to this path: `static/logo.png`.
2. Start or reload your dev server (`npm run dev` or `yarn dev`).
3. Open the site — the Navbar will display the image logo.
