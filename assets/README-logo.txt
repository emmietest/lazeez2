Place the provided Lazeez Eats logo image here as `logo.png`.

Path (workspace-relative): static/logo.png

When using Vite, files in `static/` are served at the site root. After placing the image, the Navbar will load it at `/logo.png`.

Steps:
1. Save the attached image to this path: `static/logo.png`.
2. Start or reload your dev server (`npm run dev` or `yarn dev`).
3. Open the site — the Navbar will display the image logo.

If you want me to add the actual image file into the repo, upload the image or allow me to embed it as base64 and I'll add it for you.
